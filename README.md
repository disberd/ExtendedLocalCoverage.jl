This package simply extends the functionality of [LocalCoverage.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/LocalCoverage.jl) by adding the following features:
- Automatically extract the source files for the provided package using `Revise.parse_pkg_files`.
- Automatically create an xml cobertura coverage and an html report using `pycobertura`.
  - The `pycobertura` library is automatically installed and used thanks to `CondaPkg.jl` and `PythonCall.jl`, not requiring the user to manually install python or `lcov` which is only available on non-windows systems.

This package was mainly created to provide easier access to code coverage within a private self-hosted gitlab instance, where codecov can not be used as is, but an HTML coverage report can be directly integrated within the gitlab web interface.

It is also convenient for getting an HTML coverage report locally without always relying on codecov from GH actions.

You can see an example of the generated HTML coverage report [here](https://disberd.github.io/ExtendedLocalCoverage.jl/coverage_example/), which was generated by calling `generate_package_coverage(; force_paths_relative = true)` on the [PlutoPlotly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoPlotly.jl) package.

## Installation
The package is not currently registered in General, so you need to add it to your environment by doing:
```julia
] add https://github.com/disberd/ExtendedLocalCoverage.jl
```
or 
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/disberd/ExtendedLocalCoverage.jl")
```

## Usage
For the basic usage which automatically extracts source files (including extensions) and generates the coverage report both in xml and html format, you can simply do the following (within the env of the package you are developing and making sure you have ExtendedLocalCoverage.jl in the `LOAD_PATH`):
```julia
using ExtendedLocalCoverage
cov_data = generate_package_coverage();
```

See the [developer documentation](https://disberd.github.io/ExtendedLocalCoverage.jl/dev) for more details.
