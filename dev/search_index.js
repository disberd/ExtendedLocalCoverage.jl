This acts similary to (and based on) the generate_coverage function from LocalCoverage.jl, but providing two main differences:\n\nIt automatically extracts the list of files included by the package using Revise.parse_pkg_files.\nIt allows to generate an HTML report (does so by default) using the pycobertura Python package which is installed by default via CondaPkg.\nIn contrast, the HTML report from LocalCoverage.jl relies on lcov being already available on your system and does not work on Windows machines.\n\nKeyword arguments (and their defaults)\n\nuse_existing_lcov = false if true, the coverage is assumed to be already computed and available in coverage/lcov.info within the package directory. If false, the coverage is generated from scratch calling LocalCoverage.generate_coverage.\nrun_test = true this is forwarded to LocalCoverage.generate_coverage and determines whether tests are executed. When false, test execution\n\nstep is skipped allowing an easier use in combination with other test packages.\n\ntest_args = [\"\"] this is forwarded to LocalCoverage.generate_coverage and is there passed on to Pkg.test.\nexclude = [] is used to specify string or regexes that are used to filter out some of the files in the list of package includes. The exclusion is done by removing from the list of files all files for which occursin(needle, filename) returns true, where needle is any element of exclude.\nhtml_name = \"index.html\" is the name of the HTML file to be generated. If nothing is provided, no HTML report is generated. The report is always generated in the coverage subdirectory of the target package directory.\ncobertura_name = \"cobertura-coverage.xml\" is the name of the cobertura XML file to be generated. If nothing is provided both to this kwarg and to html_name, no cobertura XML file is generated. The file is always generated in the coverage subdirectory of the target package directory.\nprint_to_stdout = true determines whether the coverage summary is printed to the standard output.\nforce_paths_relative = false determines whether the paths in the lcov.info file are processed to make sure they are relative to the package directory. This is needed in some corner cases, especially if one wants the html file to correctly show source code for the files in the report.\n\nReturn values\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with the following fields:\n\ncov the coverage summary as returned by LocalCoverage.generate_coverage.\ncobertura_file the full path to the cobertura XML file, if any was generated.\nhtml_file the full path to the HTML file, if any was generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"90-contributing/#contributing","page":"Contributing guidelines","title":"Contributing guidelines","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"90-contributing/","page":"Contributing guidelines","title":"Contributing guidelines","text":"First of all, thanks for the interest!","category":"page"},{"location":"90-contributing/","page":"Contributing guidelines","title":"Contributing guidelines","text":"We welcome all kinds of contribution, including, but not limited to code, documentation, examples, configuration, issue creating, etc.","category":"page"},{"location":"90-contributing/","page":"Contributing guidelines","title":"Contributing guidelines","text":"Be polite and respectful, and follow the code of conduct.","category":"page"},{"location":"90-contributing/#Bug-reports-and-discussions","page":"Contributing guidelines","title":"Bug reports and discussions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"90-contributing/","page":"Contributing guidelines","title":"Contributing guidelines","text":"If you think you found a bug, feel free to open an issue.
